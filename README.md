# CircleGa

An homage to Galaga. Most of this was built over a 10-12 hour period. We will be adding to it though if it's fun.

## Story

In a far and distant galaxy, an empire is growing. It holds its home star as its symbol, the representation of their dying god.

You play as a star commander, ordered by your distant Lord to eradicate an alien race. You are promised a piece of land in exchange for your services.

The game opens with a briefing, and then the opening level. Each level consists of a set of enemies to fight, and an intermittent screen that is either a report from your commanding lord, or an excerpt from an old text from a lost world.

### Why this story?

Various pieces of enlightenment philosophy and excerpts of literature about the genocide of the American Indians show up on screen between each of the levels. These excerpts, juxtaposed with the gameplay, intend to make a statement about what sorts of things become our past times, and what ways people benefit from systems that were created through horrific violence. Most of all, this horrific violence isn't even thought of by the people who actually benefit from such a system--hence a menu screen with an odd-looking DOS terminal.
